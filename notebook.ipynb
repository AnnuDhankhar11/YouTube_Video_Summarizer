      " In the last chapter, you and I started to step through the internal workings of a transformer. This is one of the key pieces of technology inside large language models, and a lot of other tools in the modern wave of AI. It first hit the scene in a now-famous 2017 paper called Attention is All You Need, and in this chapter you and I will dig into what this attention mechanism is, visualizing how it processes data. As a quick recap, here's the important context I want you to have in mind. The goal of the model that you and I are studying is to take in a piece of text and predict what word comes next. The input text is broken up into little pieces that we call tokens, and these are very often words or pieces of words, but just to make the examples in this video easier for you and me to think about, let's simplify by pretending that tokens are always just words. The first step in a transformer is to associate each token with a high-dimensional vector, what we call its embedding. The most important idea I want you to have in mind is how directions in this high-dimensional space of all possible embeddings can correspond with semantic meaning. In the last chapter we saw an example for how direction can correspond to gender, in the sense that adding a certain step in this space can take you from the embedding of a masculine noun to the embedding of the corresponding feminine noun. That's just one example you could imagine how many other directions in this high-dimensional space could correspond to numerous other aspects of a word's meaning. The aim of a transformer is to progressively adjust these embeddings so that they don't merely encode an individual word, but instead they bake in some much, much richer contextual meaning. I should say up front that a lot of people find the attention mechanism, this key piece in a transformer, very confusing, so don't worry if it takes some time for things to sink in. I think that before we dive into the computational details and all the matrix multiplications, it's worth thinking about a couple examples for the kind of behavior that we want attention to enable. Consider the phrases American shrew mole, one mole of carbon dioxide, and take a biopsy of the mole. You and I know that the word mole has different meanings in each one of these, based on the context. But after the first step of a transformer, the one that breaks up the text and associates each token with a vector, the vector that's associated with mole would be the same in all of these cases, because this initial token embedding is effectively a lookup table with no reference to the context. It's only in the next step of the transformer that the surrounding embeddings have the chance to pass information into this one. The picture you might have in mind is that there are multiple distinct directions in this embedding space encoding the multiple distinct meanings of the word mole, and that a well-trained attention block calculates what you need to add to the generic embedding to move it to one of these specific directions, as a function of the context. To take another example, consider the embedding of the word tower. This is presumably some very generic, non-specific direction in the space, associated with lots of other large, tall nouns. If this word was immediately preceded by Eiffel, you could imagine wanting the mechanism to update this vector so that it points in a direction that more specifically encodes the Eiffel tower, maybe correlated with vectors associated with Paris and France and things made of steel. If it was also preceded by the word miniature, then the vector should be updated even further, so that it no longer correlates with large, tall things. More generally than just refining the meaning of a word, the attention block allows the model to move information encoded in one embedding to that of another, potentially ones that are quite far away, and potentially with information that's much richer than just a single word. What we saw in the last chapter was how after all of the vectors flow through the network, including many different attention blocks, the computation you perform to produce a prediction of the next token is entirely a function of the last vector in the sequence. Imagine, for example, that the text you input is most of an entire mystery novel, all the way up to a point near the end, which reads, therefore the murderer was. If the model is going to accurately predict the next word, that final vector in the sequence, which began its life simply embedding the word was, will have to have been updated by all of the attention blocks to represent much, much more than any individual word, somehow encoding all of the information from the full context window that's relevant to predicting the next word. To step through the computations, though, let's take a much simpler example. Imagine that the input includes the phrase, a fluffy blue creature roamed the verdant forest. And for the moment, suppose that the only type of update that we care about is having the adjectives adjust the meanings of their corresponding nouns. What I'm about to describe is what we would call a single head of attention, and later we will see how the attention block consists of many different heads run in parallel. Again, the initial embedding for each word is some high dimensional vector that only encodes the meaning of that particular word with no context. Actually, that's not quite true. They also encode the position of the word. There's a lot more to say about the specific way that positions are encoded, but right now, all you need to know is that the entries of this vector are enough to tell you both what the word is and where it exists in the context. Let's go ahead and denote these embeddings with the letter e. The goal is to have a series of computations produce a new refined set of embeddings where, for example, those corresponding to the nouns have ingested the meaning from their corresponding adjectives. And playing the deep learning game, we want most of the computations involved to look like matrix-vector products, where the matrices are full of tuneable weights, things that the model will learn based on data. To be clear, I'm making up this example of adjectives updating nouns just to illustrate the type of behavior that you could imagine an attention head doing. As with so much deep learning, the true behavior is much harder to parse because it's based on tweaking and tuning a huge number of parameters to minimize some cost function. It's just that as we step through all of different matrices filled with parameters that are involved in this process, I think it's really helpful to have an imagined example of something that it could be doing to help keep it all more concrete. For the first step of this process, you might imagine each noun, like creature, asking the question, hey, are there any adjectives sitting in front of me? And for the words fluffy and blue, to each be able to answer, yeah, I'm an adjective and I'm in that position. That question is somehow encoded as yet another vector, another list of numbers, which we call the query for this word. This query vector though has a much smaller dimension than the embedding vector, say 128. Computing this query looks like taking a certain matrix, which I'll label wq, and multiplying it by the embedding. Compressing things a bit, let's write that query vector as q, and then anytime you see me put a matrix next to an arrow like this one, it's meant to represent that multiplying this matrix by the vector at the arrow's start gives you the vector at the arrow's end. In this case, you multiply this matrix by all of the embeddings in the context, producing one query vector for each token. The entries of this matrix are parameters of the model, which means the true behavior is learned from data, and in practice, what this matrix does in a particular attention head is challenging to parse. But for our sake, imagining an example that we might hope that it would learn, we'll suppose that this query matrix maps the embeddings of nouns to certain directions in this smaller query space that somehow encodes the notion of looking for adjectives in preceding positions. As to what it does to other embeddings, who knows? Maybe it simultaneously tries to accomplish some other goal with those. Right now, we're laser focused on the nouns. At the same time, associated with this is a second matrix called the key matrix, which you also multiply by every one of the embeddings. This produces a second sequence of vectors that we call the keys. Conceptually, you want to think of the keys as potentially answering the queries. This key matrix is also full of tuneable parameters, and just like the query matrix, it maps the embedding vectors to that same smaller dimensional space. You think of the keys as matching the queries whenever they closely align with each other. In our example, you would imagine that the key matrix maps the adjectives like fluffy and blue to vectors that are closely aligned with the query produced by the word creature. To measure how well each key matches each query, you compute a dot product between each possible key-query pair. I like to visualize a grid full of a bunch of dots, where the bigger dots correspond to the larger dot products, the places where the keys and queries align. For our adjective noun example, that would look a little more like this, where if the keys produced by fluffy and blue really do align closely with the query produced by creature, then the dot products in these two spots would be some large positive numbers. In the lingo, machine learning people would say that this means the embeddings of fluffy and blue attend to the embedding of creature. By contrast to the dot product between the key for some other word like the and the query for creature would be some small or negative value that reflects that are unrelated to each other. So we have this grid of values that can be any real number from negative infinity to infinity, giving us a score for how relevant each word is to updating the meaning of every other word. The way we're about to use these scores is to take a certain weighted sum along each column, weighted by the relevance. So instead of having values range from negative infinity to infinity, what we want is for the numbers in these columns to be between 0 and 1, and for each column to add up to 1, as if they were a probability distribution. If you're coming in from the last chapter, you know what we need to do then. We compute a softmax along each one of these columns to normalize the values. In our picture, after you apply softmax to all of the columns, we'll fill in the grid with these normalized values. At this point you're safe to think about each column as giving weights according to how relevant the word on the left is to the corresponding value at the top. We call this grid an attention pattern. Now if you look at the original transformer paper, there's a really compact way that they write this all down. Here the variables q and k represent the full arrays of query and key vectors respectively, those little vectors you get by multiplying the embeddings by the query and the key matrices. This expression up in the numerator is a really compact way to represent the grid of all possible dot products between pairs of keys and queries. A small technical detail that I didn't mention is that for numerical stability, it happens to be helpful to divide all of these values by the square root of the dimension in that key query space. Then this softmax that's wrapped around the full expression is meant to be understood to apply column by column. As to that v term, we'll talk about it in just a second. Before that, there's one other technical detail that so far I've skipped. During the training process, when you run this model on a given text example, and all of the weights are slightly adjusted and tuned to either reward or punish it based on how high a probability it assigns to the true next word in the passage, it turns out to make the whole training process a lot more efficient if you simultaneously have it predict every possible next token following each initial subsequence of tokens in this passage. For example, with the phrase that we've been focusing on, it might also be predicting what words follow creature and what words follow the. This is really nice, because it means what would otherwise be a single training example effectively acts as many. For the purposes of our attention pattern, it means that you never want to allow later words to influence earlier words, since otherwise they could kind of give away the answer for what comes next. What this means is that we want all of these spots here, the ones representing later tokens influencing earlier ones, to somehow be forced to be zero. The simplest thing you might think to do is to set them equal to zero, but if you did that the columns wouldn't add up to one anymore, they wouldn't be normalized. So instead, a common way to do this is that before applying softmax, you set all of those entries to be negative infinity. If you do that, then after applying softmax, all of those get turned into zero, but the columns stay normalized. This process is called masking. There are versions of attention where you don't apply it, but in our GPT example, even though this is more relevant during the training phase than it would be, say, running it as a chatbot or something like that, you do always apply this masking to prevent later tokens from influencing earlier ones. Another fact that's worth reflecting on about this attention pattern is how its size is equal to the square of the context size. So this is why context size can be a really huge bottleneck for large language models, and scaling it up is non-trivial. As you imagine, motivated by a desire for bigger and bigger context windows, recent years have seen some variations to the attention mechanism aimed at making context more scalable, but right here, you and I are staying focused on the basics. Okay, great, computing this pattern lets the model deduce which words are relevant to which other words. Now you need to actually update the embeddings, allowing words to pass information to whichever other words they're relevant to. For example, you want the embedding of Fluffy to somehow cause a change to Creature that moves it to a different part of this 12,000-dimensional embedding space that more specifically encodes a Fluffy creature. What I'm going to do here is first show you the most straightforward way that you could do this, though there's a slight way that this gets modified in the context of multi-headed attention. This most straightforward way would be to use a third matrix, what we call the value matrix, which you multiply by the embedding of that first word, for example Fluffy. The result of this is what you would call a value vector, and this is something that you add to the embedding of the second word, in this case something you add to the embedding of Creature. So this value vector lives in the same very high-dimensional space as the embeddings. When you multiply this value matrix by the embedding of a word, you might think of it as saying, if this word is relevant to adjusting the meaning of something else, what exactly should be added to the embedding of that something else in order to reflect this? Looking back in our diagram, let's set aside all of the keys and the queries, since after you compute the attention pattern you're done with those, then you're going to take this value matrix and multiply it by every one of those embeddings to produce a sequence of value vectors. You might think of these value vectors as being kind of associated with the corresponding keys. For each column in this diagram, you multiply each of the value vectors by the corresponding weight in that column. For example here, under the embedding of Creature, you would be adding large proportions of the value vectors for Fluffy and Blue, while all of the other value vectors get zeroed out, or at least nearly zeroed out. And then finally, the way to actually update the embedding associated with this column, previously encoding some context-free meaning of Creature, you add together all of these rescaled values in the column, producing a change that you want to add, that I'll label delta-e, and then you add that to the original embedding. Hopefully what results is a more refined vector encoding the more contextually rich meaning, like that of a fluffy blue creature. And of course you don't just do this to one embedding, you apply the same weighted sum across all of the columns in this picture, producing a sequence of changes, adding all of those changes to the corresponding embeddings, produces a full sequence of more refined embeddings popping out of the attention block. Zooming out, this whole process is what you would describe as a single head of attention. As I've described things so far, this process is parameterized by three distinct matrices, all filled with tunable parameters, the key, the query, and the value. I want to take a moment to continue what we started in the last chapter, with the scorekeeping where we count up the total number of model parameters using the numbers from GPT-3. These key and query matrices each have 12,288 columns, matching the embedding dimension, and 128 rows, matching the dimension of that smaller key query space. This gives us an additional 1.5 million or so parameters for each one. If you look at that value matrix by contrast, the way I've described things so far would suggest that it's a square matrix that has 12,288 columns and 12,288 rows, since both its inputs and outputs live in this very large embedding space. If true, that would mean about 150 million added parameters. And to be clear, you could do that. You could devote orders of magnitude more parameters to the value map than to the key and query. But in practice, it is much more efficient if instead you make it so that the number of parameters devoted to this value map is the same as the number devoted to the key and the query. This is especially relevant in the setting of running multiple attention heads in parallel. The way this looks is that the value map is factored as a product of two smaller matrices. Conceptually, I would still encourage you to think about the overall linear map, one with inputs and outputs, both in this larger embedding space, for example taking the embedding of blue to this blueness direction that you would add to nouns. The first matrix on the right here has a smaller number of rows, typically the same size as the key-query space What this means is you can think of it as mapping the large embedding vectors down to a much smaller space. This is not the conventional naming, but I'm going to call this the value down matrix. The second matrix maps from this smaller space back up to the embedding space, producing the vectors that you use to make the actual updates. I'm going to call this one the value up matrix, which again is not conventional. The way that you would see this written in most papers looks a little different. I'll talk about it in a minute. In my opinion, it tends to make things a little more conceptually confusing. To throw in linear algebra jargon here, what we're basically doing is constraining the overall value map to be a low rank transformation. Turning back to the parameter count, all four of these matrices have the same size, and adding them all up we get about 6.3 million parameters for one attention head. As a quick side note, to be a little more accurate, everything described so far is what people would call a self-attention head, to distinguish it from a variation that comes up in other models that's called cross-attention. This isn't relevant to our GPT example, but if you're curious, cross-attention involves models that process two distinct types of data, like text in one language and text in another language that's part of an ongoing generation of a translation, or maybe audio input of speech and an ongoing transcription. A cross-attention head looks almost identical. The only difference is that the key and query maps act on different data sets. In a model doing translation, for example, the keys might come from one language, while the queries come from another, and the attention pattern could describe which words from one language correspond to which words in another. And in this setting there would typically be no masking, since there's not really any notion of later tokens affecting earlier ones. Staying focused on self-attention though, if you understood everything so far, and if you were to stop here, you would come away with the essence of what attention really is. All that's really left to us is to lay out the sense in which you do this many many different times. In our central example we focused on adjectives updating nouns, but of course there are lots of different ways that context can influence the meaning of a word. If the words they crashed the preceded the word car, it has implications for the shape and structure of that car. And a lot of associations might be less grammatical. If the word wizard is anywhere in the same passage as Harry, it suggests that this might be referring to Harry Potter, whereas if instead the words Queen, Sussex, and William were in that passage, then perhaps the embedding of Harry should instead be updated to refer to the prince. For every different type of contextual updating that you might imagine, the parameters of these key and query matrices would be different to capture the different attention patterns, and the parameters of our value map would be different based on what should be added to the embeddings. And again, in practice the true behavior of these maps is much more difficult to interpret, where the weights are set to do whatever the model needs them to do to best accomplish its goal of predicting the next token. As I said before, everything we described is a single head of attention, and a full attention block inside a transformer consists of what's called multi-headed attention, where you run a lot of these operations in parallel, each with its own distinct key query and value maps. GPT-3 for example uses 96 attention heads inside each block. Considering that each one is already a bit confusing, it's certainly a lot to hold in your head. Just to spell it all out very explicitly, this means you have 96 distinct key and query matrices producing 96 distinct attention patterns. Then each head has its own distinct value matrices used to produce 96 sequences of value vectors. These are all added together using the corresponding attention patterns as weights. What this means is that for each position in the context, each token, every one of these heads produces a proposed change to be added to the embedding in that position. So what you do is you sum together all of those proposed changes, one for each head, and you add the result to the original embedding of that position. This entire sum here would be one slice of what's outputted from this multi-headed attention block, a single one of those refined embeddings that pops out the other end of it. Again, this is a lot to think about, so don't worry at all if it takes some time to sink in. The overall idea is that by running many distinct heads in parallel, you're giving the model the capacity to learn many distinct ways that context changes meaning. Pulling up our running tally for parameter count with 96 heads, each including its own variation of these four matrices, each block of multi-headed attention ends up with around 600 million parameters. There's one added slightly annoying thing that I should really mention for any of you who go on to read more about transformers. You remember how I said that the value map is factored out into these two distinct matrices, which I labeled as the value down and the value up matrices. The way that I framed things would suggest that you see this pair of matrices inside each attention head, and you could absolutely implement it this way. That would be a valid design. But the way that you see this written in papers and the way that it's implemented in practice looks a little different. All of these value up matrices for each head appear stapled together in one giant matrix that we call the output matrix, associated with the entire multi-headed attention block. And when you see people refer to the value matrix for a given attention head, they're typically only referring to this first step, the one that I was labeling as the value down projection into the smaller space. For the curious among you, I've left an on-screen note about it. It's one of those details that runs the risk of distracting from the main conceptual points, but I do want to call it out just so that you know if you read about this in other sources. Setting aside all the technical nuances, in the preview from the last chapter we saw how data flowing through a transformer doesn't just flow through a single attention block. For one thing, it also goes through these other operations called multi-layer perceptrons. We'll talk more about those in the next chapter. And then it repeatedly goes through many many copies of both of these operations. What this means is that after a given word imbibes some of its context, there are many more chances for this more nuanced embedding to be influenced by its more nuanced surroundings. The further down the network you go, with each embedding taking in more and more meaning from all the other embeddings, which themselves are getting more and more nuanced, the hope is that there's the capacity to encode higher level and more abstract ideas about a given input beyond just descriptors and grammatical structure. Things like sentiment and tone and whether it's a poem and what underlying scientific truths are relevant to the piece and things like that. Turning back one more time to our scorekeeping, GPT-3 includes 96 distinct layers, so the total number of key query and value parameters is multiplied by another 96, which brings the total sum to just under 58 billion distinct parameters devoted to all of the attention heads. That is a lot to be sure, but it's only about a third of the 175 billion that are in the network in total. So even though attention gets all of the attention, the majority of parameters come from the blocks sitting in between these steps. In the next chapter, you and I will talk more about those other blocks and also a lot more about the training process. A big part of the story for the success of the attention mechanism is not so much any specific kind of behaviour that it enables, but the fact that it's extremely parallelizable, meaning that you can run a huge number of computations in a short time using GPUs. Given that one of the big lessons about deep learning in the last decade or two has been that scale alone seems to give huge qualitative improvements in model performance, there's a huge advantage to parallelizable architectures that let you do this. If you want to learn more about this stuff, I've left lots of links in the description. In particular, anything produced by Andrej Karpathy or Chris Ola tend to be pure gold. In this video, I wanted to just jump into attention in its current form, but if you're curious about more of the history for how we got here and how you might reinvent this idea for yourself, my friend Vivek just put up a couple videos giving a lot more of that motivation. Also, Britt Cruz from the channel The Art of the Problem has a really nice video about the history of large language models. Thank you.\n"

      " in the last chapter you and I started to step through the internal workings of a transformer this is one of the key pieces of Technology inside large language models and a lot of other tools in the Modern Wave of AI it first hit the scene in a now famous 2017 paper called attention is all you need and in this chapter you and I will dig into what this attention mechanism is visualizing how it processes data as a quick recap here's the important context I want you to have in mind the goal of the model that you and I are studying is to take in a piece of text and predict what word comes next the input text is broken up into little pieces that we call tokens and these are very often words or pieces of words but just to make the examples in this video easier for you and me to think about let's simplify by pretending that tokens are always just words the first step in a Transformer is to associate each token with a high dimensional Vector what we call its embedding now the most important idea I want you to have in mind is how directions in this high-dimensional space of all possible embeddings can correspond with semantic meaning in the last chapter we saw an example for how Direction can correspond to gender in the sense that adding a certain step in this space can take you from the embedding of a masculine noun to the embedding of the corresponding feminine noun that's just one example you could imagine how many other directions in this high-dimensional space could correspond to numerous other aspects of a word's meaning the aim of a transformer is to progressively adjust these embeddings so that they don't merely encode an individual word but instead they bake in some much much richer contextual meaning I should say up front that a lot of people find the attention mechanism this key piece in a Transformer very confusing so don't worry if it takes some time for things to sink in I think that before we dive into the computational details and all the Matrix multiplications it's worth thinking about a couple examples for the kind of behavior that we want attention to enable consider the phrases American true mole one mole of carbon dioxide and take a biopsy of the mole you and I know that the word mole has different meanings in each one of these based on the context but after the first step of a transformer the one that breaks up the text and Associates each token with a vector the vector that's associated with mole would be the same in all three of these cases because this initial token embedding is effectively a lookup table with no reference to the context it's only in the next step of the Transformer that the surrounding embeddings have the chance to pass information into this one the picture you might have in mind is that there are multiple distinct directions in this embedding space encoding the multiple distinct meanings of the word mole and that a well-trained attention block calculates what you need to add to the generic embedding to move it to one of these more specific directions as a function of the context to take another example consider the embedding of the word tower this is presumably some very generic non-specific Direction in the space associated with lots of other large tall nouns if this word was immediately preceded by Eiffel you could imagine wanting the mechanism to update this Vector so that it points in a direction that more specifically encodes the Eiffel Tower maybe correlated with vectors associated with Paris and France and things made of steel if it was also preceded by the word miniature then the vector should be updated even further so that it no longer correlates with large tall things more generally than just refining the meaning of a word the attention block allows the model to move information encoded in one embedding to that of another potentially ones that are quite far away and potentially with information that's much richer than just a single word what we saw in the last chapter was how after all of the vectors flow through the network including many different attention blocks the computation that you perform to produce a prediction of the next token is entirely a function of the last Vector in the sequence so imagine for example that the text you input is most of an entire mystery novel all the way up to a point near the end which reads therefore the murderer was if the model's going to accurately predict the next word that final Vector in the sequence which began its life simply embedding the word was will have to have been updated by all of the attention blocks to represent much much more than any individual word somehow encoding all of the information from the full context window that's relevant to predicting the next word to step through the computations though let's take a much simpler example imagine that the input includes the phrase a fluffy blue creature roamed The Verdant forest and for the moment suppose that the only type of update that we care about is having the adjectives adjust the meanings of their corresponding nouns what I'm about to describe is what we would call a single head of attention and later we will see how the attention block consists of many different heads run in parallel again the initial embedding for each word is some high-dimensional vector that only encodes the meaning of that particular word with no context actually that's not quite true they also encode the position of the word there's a lot more to say about the specific way that positions are encoded but right now all you need to know is that the entries of this Vector are enough to tell you both what the word is and where it exists in the context let's go ahead and denote these embeddings with the letter E the goal is to have a series of computations produce a new refined set of embeddings where for example those corresponding to the nouns have ingested the meaning from their corresponding adjectives and playing the Deep learning game we want most of the computations involved to look like Matrix Vector products where the matrices are full of tunable weights things that the model will learn Based on data to be clear I'm making up this example of adjectives updating nouns just to illustrate the type of behavior that you could imagine an intention head doing as with so much deep learning the true behavior is much harder to parse because it's based on tweaking and tuning a huge number of parameters to minimize some cost function it's just that as we step through all of the different matrices filled with parameters that are involved in this process I think it's really helpful to have an imagined example of something that it could be doing to help keep it all more concrete for the first step of this process you might imagine each noun like creature asking the question hey are there any adjectives sitting in front of me and for the words fluffy and blue to each be able to answer yeah I'm an adjective and I'm in that position that question is somehow encoded as yet another Vector another list of numbers which we call the query for this word this query Vector though has a much smaller Dimension than the embedding Vector say 128 Computing this query looks like taking a certain Matrix which I'll label WQ and multiplying it by the embedding compressing things a bit let's write that query Vector as q and then anytime you see me put a matrix next to an arrow like this one it's meant to represent that multiplying this matrix by the vector at the Arrow's start gives you the vector at the Arrow's end in this case you multiply this matrix by all of the embeddings in the context producing one query Vector for each token the entries of this Matrix are parameters of the model which means the true behavior is learned from data and in practice what this Matrix does in a particular attention head is challenging to parse but for our sake imagining an example that we might hope that it would learn we'll suppose that this query Matrix Maps the embed Bings of nouns to certain directions in this smaller query space that somehow encodes the notion of looking for adjectives in preceding positions as to what it does to other embeddings who knows maybe it simultaneously tries to accomplish some other goal with those right now we're laser focused on the nouns at the same time associated with this is a second Matrix called the key Matrix which you also multiply by every one of the embeddings this produces a second sequence of vectors that we call the keys consider seally you want to think of the keys as potentially answering the queries this key Matrix is also full of tunable parameters and just like the query Matrix It Maps the embedding vectors to that same smaller dimensional space you think of the keys as matching the queries whenever they closely align with each other in our example you would imagine that the key Matrix Maps the adjectives like fluffy and blue to vectors that are closely aligned with the query produced by the word creature to measure how well each key matches each query you compute a DOT product between each possible key query pair I like to visualize a grid full of a bunch of dots where the bigger dots correspond to the larger dot products the places where the keys and queries align for our adjective noun example that would look a little more like this where if the keys produced by fluffy and blue really do align closely with the query produced by creature then the dot products in these two spots would be some large positive numbers in the link dingo machine learning people would say that this means the embeddings of fluffy and blue attend to the embedding of creature by contrast to the dot product between the key for some other word like the and the query for creature would be some small or negative value that reflects that these are unrelated to each other so we have this grid of values that can be any real number from negative Infinity to Infinity giving us a score for how relevant each word is to updating the meaning of every other word the way we're about to use these scores is to take a certain weighted Sum along each column weighted by the relevance so instead of having values range from negative Infinity to Infinity what we want is for the numbers in these columns to be between 0 and 1 and for each column to add up to one as if they were a probability distribution if you're coming in from the last chapter you know what we need to do then we compute a soft Max along each one of these columns to normalize the values in our picture after you apply softmax to all of the columns we'll fill in the grid with these normalized values at this point you're safe to think about each column as giving weights according to how relevant the word on the left is to the corresponding value at the top we call this grid an attention pattern now if you look at the original Transformer paper there's a really compact way that they write this all down here the variables q and K represent the full arrays of query and key vector vectors respectively those little vectors you get by multiplying the embeddings by the query and the key matrices this expression up in the numerator is a really compact way to represent the grid of all possible dot products between Pairs of keys and queries a small technical detail that I didn't mention is that for numerical stability it happens to be helpful to divide all of these values by the square root of the dimension in that key query space then this soft Max that's wrapped around the full expression is meant to be understood to apply column by column as to that V term we'll talk about it in just a second before that there's one other technical detail that so far I have skipped during the training process when you run this model on a given text example and all of the weights are slightly adjusted and tuned to either reward or punish it based on how high a probability it assigns to the true next word in the passage it turns out to make the whole training process a lot more efficient if you simultaneously have it predict every possible next token following each initial subsequence of tokens in this passage for example with the phrase that we've been focusing on it might also be predicting what words follow creature and what words follow the this is really nice because it means what would otherwise be a single training example effectively acts as many for the purposes of our attention pattern it means that you never want to allow later words to influence earlier words since otherwise they could kind of give away the answer for what comes next what this means is that we want all of these spots here the ones ones representing later tokens influencing earlier ones to somehow be forced to be zero the simplest thing you might think to do is to set them equal to zero but if you did that the columns wouldn't add up to one anymore they wouldn't be normalized so instead a common way to do this is that before applying softmax you set all of those entries to be negative Infinity if you do that then after applying soft Max all of those get turned into zero but the columns stay normalized this process is called masking there are versions of attention where you don't apply it but in our GPT example even though this is more relevant during the training phase than it would be say running it as a chatbot or something like that you do always apply this masking to prevent later tokens from influencing earlier ones another fact that's worth reflecting on about this attention pattern is how its size is equal to the square of the context size so this is why context size can be a really huge bottleneck for large language models and scaling it up is non-trivial As you might imagine motivated by a desire for bigger and bigger context Windows recent years have seen some variations to the attention mechanism aimed at making context more scalable but right here you and I are staying focused on the basics okay great Computing this pattern lets the model deduce which words are relevant to which other words now you need to actually update the embeddings allowing words to pass information to whichever other words they're relevant to for example you want the embedding of fluffy to somehow cause a change to creature that moves it to a different part of this 12,000 dimensional embedding space that more specifically encodes a fluffy creature what I'm going to do here is first show you the most straightforward way that you could do this though there's a slight way that this gets modified in the context of multi-headed attention this most straightforward way would be to use a third Matrix what we call the value Matrix which you multiply by the embedding of that first word for example fluffy the result of this is what you would call a value vector and this is something that you add to the embedding of the SE word in this case something you add to the embedding of creature so this value Vector lives in the same very high dimensional space as the embeddings when you multiply this value matrix by the embedding of a word you might think of it as saying if this word is relevant to adjusting the meaning of something else what exactly should be added to the embedding of that something else in order to reflect this looking back in our diagram let's set aside all of the keys and the queries since after you compute the attention pattern you're done with those then you're going to take this value Matrix and multiply it by every one of those embeddings to produce a sequence of value vectors you might think of these value vectors as being kind of associated with the corresponding keys for each column in this diagram you multiply each of the value vectors by the corresponding weight in that column for example here under the embedding of creature you would be adding large proportions of the value vectors for fluffy and blue while all of the other value vectors get zero out or at least nearly zero out and then finally the way to actually update the embedding associated with this column previously encoding some context-free meaning of creature you add together all of these rescaled values in the column producing a change that you want to add that all label Delta e and then you add that to the original embedding hopefully what results is a more refined Vector encoding the more contextually Rich meaning like that of a fluffy blue creature and of course you don't just do this to one embedding you apply the same weighted sum across all of the columns in this picture producing a sequence of changes adding all of those changes to the corresponding embeddings produces a full sequence of more refined embeddings popping out of the attention block zooming out this whole process is what you would describe as a single head of attention as I've described things so far this process is parameterized by three distinct matrices all filled with tunable parameters the key the query and the value I want to take a moment to continue what we started in the last chapter with the scorekeeping where we count up the total number of model parameters using the numbers from gpt3 these key and query matrices each have 12,288 columns matching the embedding Dimension and 128 rows matching the dimension of that smaller key query space this gives us an additional 1.5 million or so parameters for each one if you look at that value matrix by contrast the way I've described things so far would suggest that it's a square Matrix that has 12,288 columns and 12,288 rows since both its inputs and its outputs live in this very large embedding space if true that would mean about 150 million added parameters and to be clear you could do that you could devote orders of magnitude more parameters to the value map than to the key in query but in practice it is much more efficient If instead you make it so that the number of parameters devoted to this value map is the same as the number devoted to the key in the query this is especially relevant in the setting of running multiple attention heads in parallel the way this looks is that the value map is factored as a product of two smaller matrices conceptually I would still encourage you to think about the overall linear map one with inputs and outputs both in this larger embedding space for example taking the embedding of blue to this bless direction that you would add to nouns it's just that it's broken up into two separate steps the first Matrix on the right here has a smaller number of rows typically the same size as the key query space what this means is you can think of it as mapping the large embedding vectors down to a much smaller space this is not the conventional naming but I'm going to call this the value down Matrix the second Matrix maps from the smaller space back up to the embedding space producing the vectors that you use to make the actual updates I'm going to call this one the value up Matrix which again is not conventional the way that you would see this written in most papers looks a little different I'll talk about it in a minute in my opinion it tends to make things a little more conceptually confusing to throw in linear algebra jargon here what we're basically doing is constraining the overall value map to be a low rank transformation turning back to the parameter count all four of these matrices have the same size and adding them all up we get about 6.3 million parameters for one attention head as a quick side note to be a little more accurate everything described so far is what people would call a self attention head to distinguish it from a very that comes up in other models that's called cross attention this isn't relevant to our GPT example but if you're curious cross attention involves models that process two distinct types of data like text in one language and text in another language that's part of an ongoing generation of a translation or maybe audio input of speech and an ongoing transcription a cross attention head looks almost identical the only difference is that the key and query Maps act on different data sets in a model doing translation for example the keys might come from one language while the queries come from another and the attention pattern could describe which words from one language correspond to which words in another and in this setting there would typically be no masking since there's not really any notion of later tokens affecting earlier ones staying focused on self attention though if you understood everything so far and if you were to stop here you would come away with the essence of what attention really is all that's really left to us is to lay out the sense sense in which you do this many many different times in our Central example we focused on adjectives updating nouns but of course there are lots of different ways that context can influence the meaning of a word if the words they crashed thee preceded the word car it has implications for the shape and the structure of that car and a lot of associations might be less grammatical if the word wizard is anywhere in the same passage as Harry it suggests that this might be referring to Harry Potter whereas if instead the words Queen Sussex and William were in that passage then perhaps the embedding of Harry should instead be updated to refer to the prince for every different type of contextual updating that you might imagine the parameters of these key inquery matrices would be different to capture the different attention patterns and the parameters of our value map would be different based on what should be added to the embeddings and again in practice the true behavior of these Maps is much more difficult to interpret where the weights are set to do whatever the model needs them to do to best accomplish its goal of predicting the next token as I said before everything we described as a single head of attention and a full attention block inside a Transformer consists of what's called multi-headed attention where you run a lot of these operations in parallel each with its own distinct key query and value maps gpt3 for example uses 96 attention heads inside each block considering that each one is already a bit confusing it's certainly a lot to hold in your head just to spell it all out very explicitly this means you have 96 distinct key and query matrices producing 96 distinct attention patterns then each head has its own distinct value matrices used to produce 96 sequences of value vectors these are all added together using the corresponding attention patterns as weights what this means is that for each position in the context each token every one of these heads produces a proposed change to be added to the embedding in that position so what you do is you sum together all of those proposed changes one for each head and you add the result to the original embedding of that position this entire sum here would be one slice of what's outputed from this multi-headed attention block a single one of those refined embeddings that pops out the other end of it again this is a lot to think about so don't worry at all if it takes some time to sink in the overall idea is that by running many distinct heads in parallel you're giving the model the capacity to learn many distinct ways that context changes meaning pulling up our running tally for parameter count with 96 heads each including its own variation of these four matrices each block of multi-headed detention ends up with around 600 million parameters there's one added slightly annoying thing that I should really mention for any of you who go on to read more about Transformers you remember how I said that the value map is factored out into these two distinct matrices which I labeled as the value down and the value up matrices the way that I framed things would suggest that you see this pair of matrices inside each attention head and you could absolutely implement it this way that would be a valid design but the way that you see this written in papers and the way that it's implemented in practice looks a little different all of these value up matrices for each head appear stapled together in one giant Matrix that we call the output Matrix associated with the entire multi-headed attention block and when you see people refer to the value Matrix for a given attention head they're typically only referring to this first step the one that I was labeling as the value down projection into the smaller space for the Curious among you I've left an on-screen note about it it's one of those details that runs the risk of distracting from the main conceptual points but I do want to call it out just so that you know if you read about this in other sources setting aside all the technical nuances in the preview from the last chapter we saw how data flowing through a Transformer doesn't just flow through a single attention block for one thing it also goes through these other operations called multi-layer perceptrons we'll talk more about those in the next chapter and then it repeatedly goes through many many copies of both of these operations what this means is that after a given word embies some of its context there are many more chances for this more nuanced embedding to be influenced by its more nuanced surroundings the further down the network you go with each embedding taking in more and more meaning from all the other embeddings which themselves are getting more and more new nuanced the hope is that there's the capacity to encode higher level and more abstract ideas about a given input Beyond just descriptors and grammatical structure things like sentiment and tone and whether it's a poem and what underlying scientific truths are relevant to the piece and things like that turning back one more time to our scorekeeping gpt3 includes 96 distinct layers so the total number of key query and value parameters is multiplied by another 96 which brings the total sum to just under 58 billion distinct parameters devoted to all of the attention heads that is a lot to be sure but it's only about a third of the 175 billion that are in the network in total so even though attention gets all of the attention the majority of parameters come from the blocks sitting in between these steps in the next chapter you and I will talk more about those other blocks and also a lot more about the training process a big part of the story for the success of the attention mechanism is not so much any specific kind of behavior that it enables but the fact that it's extremely parallelizable meaning that you can run a huge number of computations in a short time using gpus given that one of the big lessons about deep learning in the last decade or two has been that scale alone seems to give huge qualitative improvements in model performance there's a huge advantage to parallelizable architectures that let you do this if you want to learn more about this stuff I've left lots of links in the description in particular anything produced by Andre carpy or Chris Ola tend to be pure gold in this video I wanted to just jump into attention in its current form but if you're curious about more of the history for how we got here and how you might reinvent this idea for yourself my friend VC just put up a couple videos giving a lot more of that motivation also Brit Cruz from the channel the art of the problem has a really nice video about the history of large language models\n"

      "नमस्कार वेलकम टू स्टडी आ मैं हूं प्रशांत धवन और इस वीडियो में हम बात करने वाले हैं बहुत ही इंपोर्टेंट टॉपिक के बारे में हाल ही में पाकिस्तानी मीडिया ने हर जगह यह रिपोर्ट फैला दी कि पाकिस्तान में बहुत ही बड़े स्केल पर ऑयल और नेचुरल गैस के रिजर्व्स मिल चुके हैं नाउ इन्होंने यहां तक कह दिया यह जो आप लाइन देख रहे हैं यह सब पाकिस्तान मीडिया से उठाई गई है यहां पर लिखा है कि इतना ऑयल मिला है पाकिस्तान में जिससे पाकिस्तान की त तकदीर बदल सकती है इट कैन चेंज द डेस्टिनी ऑफ पाकिस्तान कई पाकिस्तानी न्यूज़ आउटलेट्स यह क्लेम कर रहे हैं कि दुनिया में चौथे सबसे बड़े ऑयल रिजर्व मिले हैं पाकिस्तान को अपने कोस्टल एरिया के पास नाउ मुझे यहां पर यह बोलना पड़ेगा एक देश जब और बाकी सेक्टर्स में फेल कर गया हो कोई आईटी इंडस्ट्री ना हो कोई मैन्युफैक्चरिंग ना हो कोई सर्विस इंडस्ट्री ना हो कुछ बेसिकली आपके कंट्री को इंटरनेशनली किसी चीज के लिए किसी चीज के एक्सपोर्ट के लिए जाना नहीं जाता सिर्फ लिटरली आपका कंट्री फेमस है टेररिज्म के लिए तो काफी बार आप कह लीजिए डिस्कवरी के कहीं से कुछ मिल जाए कहीं से ऑयल मिल जाए कहीं से नेचुरल गैस मिल जाए जिसको बेचकर एक कंट्री अपना कर्ज खत्म कर सकती है ऐसे ख्वाब एक कंट्री देखना स्टार्ट कर देता है तो लिटरली यहां पर यही कहा जा रहा है कि पाकिस्तान को उम्मीद है कि अचानक से इनको इतना तेल मिल गया है कि पूरी तकदीर पाकिस्तान की बदल जाएगी नाउ आप में से कुछ लोग हो सकता है कहे कि डेजा वू की फीलिंग आ रही है डेजा वू होता है कि यह सुना सुना लग रहा है ऐसा लग रहा है कि आज से बहुत टाइम पहले सेम खबर सब कुछ एग्जैक्ट वर्ड्स कहीं पर सुने थे जी हां बिल्कुल अगर आपको डेजा वू की फीलिंग आ रही है तो मैं आपको बता दूं 2018 में भी पाकिस्तान के जब उस वक्त पीएम थे इमरान खान इन्होंने ओपनली ये बोल दिया था कि पाकिस्तान को ऑयल और नेचुरल गैस की बड़ी डिस्कवरी हुई है उस वक्त पाकिस्तान के लोग बहुत ज्यारा खुश हो रहे थे उनको लग रहा था कि यह लकी आदमी बन गया है इनका प्राइम मिनिस्टर और इस आदमी की किस्मत इतनी अच्छी है वर्ल्ड कप जीत लेता है ऑक्सफोर्ड में पड़ा हुआ है और ओबवियसली जब यह पीएम बना तो इसने कुछ ऐसी पॉलिसी बनाई होगी कि अचानक से पाकिस्तान को ऑयल मिल गया नेचुरल गैस मिल गई बट इन दी एंड जब खुदाई हुई जब पता करने की कोशिश करी गई कि क्या कराची के कोस्ट पे कराची के कोस्ट में ऑयल नेचुरल गैस है या नहीं तो कुछ भी यहां पर ना मिला और उसके बाद आपने देखा होगा 2019 में ऐसे आर्टिकल हुए थे पब्लिश बैड न्यूज़ फॉर प्राइम मिनिस्टर इमरान खान नो ऑयल गैस रिजर्व्स फाउंड इन पाकिस्तान ऑफशोर तो मुझे लग रहा है देखिए पाकिस्तान इस बार ना एक टाइप का इंटरनेशनल स्कैम करने की कोशिश कर रहा है हो यहां पर क्या रहा है कि अभी के लिए कोई ऑयल नेचुरल गैस डिस्कवर हुए नहीं है मगर पाकिस्तान का मीडिया बार-बार ऐसी रिपोर्ट फैला रहा है और उसके बाद इनके पीएम ने यह कह दिया कि देखिए हमें 5 बिलियन डॉलर चाहिए होंगे और इनको मिल भी जाएंगे इनको उम्मीद है मिल जाएंगे ये पैसे आने वाले 3 सालों में अब यहां पे आप कहोगे 5 बिलियन डॉलर किस बात के समझाता हूं आपको को पाकिस्तान की तरफ से जब बार-बार इस बात को लेकर रिपोर्ट्स आती हैं कि यहां पे नेचुरल गैस हो सकता है ऑयल यहां पर हो सकती है तो कई इन्वेस्टर्स थोड़े बहुत इंटरेस्टेड हो जाते हैं और पाकिस्तान सिंपली इन इन्वेस्टर्स को यह कहता है कि देखो बिल्कुल ऑयल हो सकता है इतना ऑयल हो सकता है कि वेनेजुएला जैसे कंट्रीज को टक्कर दे रहा होगा पाकिस्तान ऑयल रिजर्व के मामले में बस नीड यह है के द एक्सप्लोरेशन के जब आपको पता है कि देखिए यहां पे ऑयल है मगर एगजैक्टली कहां पे है उसको आप एक्स्ट्रेट कैसे करोगे इसके लिए भी इनिशियली आपको बहुत सारा पैसा चाहिए होता है और यहां पे आप देख पाओगे एक्सप्लोरेशन अलोन रिक्वायर्ड ए हेफ्टी इन्वेस्टमेंट ऑफ अराउंड 5 बिलियन डॉलर्स और साथ ही साथ इसमें चार से पाच साल लग सकते हैं इस ऑयल को एक्सट्रैक्ट करने में अपनी ऑफशोर लोकेशन से और और शहबाज शरीफ ने आज से एक महीने पहले ये बात ओपनली कही थी कि 5 बिलियन डॉलर्स इनके पास प्लेज हो चुके हैं इनके हिसाब से अगेन मुझे पता नहीं है असल में ये हुआ नहीं हुआ क्योंकि काफी बार कुछ बोल देते हैं इन रियलिटी होता कुछ और है पाकिस्तान के पीएम ने कहा था कि वो लकी इन्वेस्टर्स जिनको पाकिस्तान में निवेश करने का मौका मिला है उन्होंने अपनी तरफ से 5 बिलियन डॉलर की इन्वेस्टमेंट कर दी है प्लेज तो होता यहां पे सिंपली क्या है यहां पे ऑब् वियस थोड़ा बहुत करप्शन होगा पाकिस्तान की मिलिट्री इनके जो सरकार के ऑफिशल्स हैं वो थोड़ा बहुत पैसा खाएंगे फिर घूम फिर के इन्वेस्टर का पैसा थोड़ा बहुत लगाया जाएगा ऑयल नेचुरल गैस की एक्सप्लोरेशन में बाकी देखिए कुछ मिले या ना मिले उसके के बारे में मैं कुछ कह नहीं सकता इमरान खान का केस मुझे प्रॉपर्ली याद है इन्होंने भी कुछ इन्वेस्टर्स को फंसाने की कोशिश करी थी इनके टाइम में 5 बिलियन डॉलर वाले इन्वेस्टर फंसे नहीं थे कुछ मिलियंस का ही इन्वेस्टमेंट हुआ था उसमें ही पता लग गया था कि जो भी ये सपने देख रहे थे कि कराची के कोस्ट में ऑयल है नेचुरल गैस है कुछ भी ऐसा रियलिटी में नहीं हुआ तो इस बार देखिए सेम स्क्रिप्ट है पाकिस्तान दुराने की कोशिश कर रहा है देखना यह होगा कि यह 5 बिलियन डॉलर की इन्वेस्टमेंट जिसका यह क्लेम कर रहे हैं कि यह पैसा पाकिस्तान के थ्रू जाएगा और यूज किया जाएगा ऑयल नेचुरल गैस की एक्सप्लोरेशन में क्या यह जेनुइनली होता भी है या फिर नहीं होता दिस विल बी वेरी इंटरेस्टिंग टू सी और अगर यहां पर आपका सवाल यह है कि मान लो हाइपोथेटिकली स्पीकिंग कि पाकिस्तान में जेनुइनली ऑयल मिल गया क्या पाकिस्तान रातों रात सऊदी अरेबिया बन जाएगा अगेन यह बहुत बड़ा फफ है उस केस में भी मैं वैसे आपको यह बता दूं सऊदी अरेबिया की सबसे बड़ी कंपनी है इनकी सरकारी ऑयल नेचुरल गैस की कंपनी अराम को ग्रामको ने ऑलरेडी 40 पर स्टेक पाकिस्तान गैस एंड ऑयल जो इनकी सरकारी कंपनी है गैस एंड ऑयल पाकिस्तान जिसको यह गो कहते हैं इसमें ऑलरेडी परचेस कर रखा है तो मेन जो यहां पर स्टेक होल्डर्स हैं ये ऑलरेडी सऊदी अरेबियन कंपनीज हैं अगर कुछ प्रॉफिट होता भी है तो उसका बड़ा परसेंटेज सऊदी अरेबिया खाएगा कुछ स्टेक बताया जाता है यूएई के इन्वेस्टर्स का भी है तो अगेन देखो ऐसा नहीं है कि पाकिस्तान की डेस्टिनी चेंज होने वाली है और अचानक से सब कुछ चेंज हो जाएगा पाकिस्तान के लिए और जो भी इनके कर्जे हैं यह चुकाना शुरू कर देंगे इस ऑयल की एक्सप्लोरेशन के बाद बट देखना यह होगा क्या क्या फिर से जो इमरान खान के अंडर पाकिस्तान ने किया था सेम चीज क्या यहां पे रिपीट होती है क्या सच में ग्लोबल इन्वेस्टर्स इतने वे मुझे वर्ड यहां पर यूज करना पड़ेगा बुद्धू हैं कि एक चीज जब वोह देख चुके हैं 2019 में फिर से एक हाईप पे बिलीव करके क्या वह 5 बिलियन डॉलर्स पाकिस्तान में प्लेज करेंगे फॉर ऑयल एंड नेचुरल गैस एक्सप्लोरेशन यह बहुत ही इंटरेस्टिंग होगा इस टॉपिक से रिलेटेड कुछ डेवलपमेंट्स आती हैं तो मैं आपके लिए बाद में अपडेटेड वीडियो लाता रहूंगा और फाइनली यहां पे आपसे पूछूंगा एक सवाल देखिए पहला इंटरनेशनल सोलर फेस्टिवल यह ऑर्गेनाइज
